In this simple app I **query an API** to render Rick and Morty's characters. There is also a **search feature**.
The app is fully **responsive**, and each card has a little hover effect.

## Technologies used:

This app was made using the Vite buid tool.
The main technologies used are **HTML, CSS and React**, together in a Node environment.
I used axios to connect to the external api and the React Spinners package to render an animation while fetching the API data.

## Usage:

To run the code as a developer please clone this repository and install the packages with `npm install`. Then run it with `npm run dev`. Make sure you have Nodejs installed.
